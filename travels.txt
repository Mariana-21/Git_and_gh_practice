My favorite travel experience was when i was traveling to south America to live in Chile for two years.
It was probably the most stressful experience but it was really fun
I feel every time i travel to Chile its always a great time.
Going from airport to airport is just the best, I know a lor of people dont really enjoy it but I love it.
